The "Smart Helmet" project aims to enhance the safety and security of bike riders through innovative technology. The helmet incorporates features such as accident detection, proximity alerts, helmet compliance verification, and alcohol detection. In the event of an accident, the helmet promptly notifies the riderâ€™s family, while proximity alerts help prevent collisions by warning the rider of nearby vehicles. The helmet ensures safety compliance by verifying it is worn before use and detects alcohol consumption to promote safe riding practices. This comprehensive solution leverages modern sensors and communication technologies to create a safer riding environment and reduce the risk of injuries and fatalities.
